# Examples

These guides walk through real-world patterns using numpy-ts. Each example includes complete, runnable TypeScript code that you can copy directly into your project.

## Prerequisites

All examples assume you have numpy-ts installed:

```bash
npm install numpy-ts
```

Most examples use the full entry point for readability:

```typescript
import * as np from 'numpy-ts';
```

For production browser bundles, consider using `numpy-ts/core` for tree-shaking. See the [Tree-Shaking guide](../guides/tree-shaking) for details.
