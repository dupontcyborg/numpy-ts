import { Playground } from "/snippets/Playground.jsx"

Write numpy-ts code and see results instantly — everything runs right in your browser using the same library you'd install from npm.

<Playground showImportHeader={true} showCopyButton={true} />

## How it works

- Code executes **in your browser** using the numpy-ts browser bundle loaded from CDN
- The `np` object is pre-loaded with all numpy-ts functions
- Use `console.log()` to print output, or return a value from the last expression
- NDArray objects display with `.toString()` formatting
- Select from built-in examples using the dropdown, or write your own code
